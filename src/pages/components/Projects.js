                        when searching for optimal roommates is being matched with one (or more) of 
                        similar interests. Currently, students must advertise themselves on platforms
                        such as Facebook or by "word of ear." Very few platforms exist that are
                        targetted at matching post-graduate roommates together.

                        As part of our capstone project for COM SCI 130: Software Engineering, we aim
                        at making roommate searching easier for post-graduate students with Zoomie
                        Roomies.
